# flappyBub

## TODO: 
* Paint a background on the canvas with the background-image CSS property
* Modify main.js to paint Mr. Bub on the canvas, and move him up and down with your keyboard
* Download any other resources you want to use, 
* Add the pipes, moving across the canvas from right to left
* Add hitboxes to detect if Mr. Bub accidentally runs into a pipe
* Add a score counter that increments (1 point per second?) as Mr. Bub dodges the pipes, and resets whenever he crashes
